/*
what we have to do here is a bit new and i dont really know how we are supposed to do all that stuff
gameplan:
step 1:
get the crypto api in and get the prices of the crypto that the consumer has asked for and take its price 
of a week
step 2:
if the price right now is less than avg and has been decresing constantly ask the user to either wait for it
to go up or sell it
if it is more than avg then ask user to either buy and hold or sell if they have profit

problems:
1. how to get real time data / API issues dont know what to do about it
2. how to take input probabaly can figure it out not sure
